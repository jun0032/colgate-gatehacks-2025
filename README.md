## Your Virtual Friend(s): a Desktop Companion with AI Vision

An Electron-based desktop overlay application that uses AI to watch and comment on your screen activity in real-time. <br><br>
Features a customizable character (Among Us crewmate, cat, Miku, or Kirby) that sits in the corner of your screen, periodically captures screenshots, analyzes what you're doing, and provides personality-driven commentary through text-to-speech. <br><br>
The always-on-top window uses a retro Windows 98 aesthetic (98.css) and allows users to select different characters, each with unique personalities - from a suspicious Among Us crewmate to a hungry Kirby. The AI maintains conversation history to avoid repetition and adapts its responses based on your current activity (coding, watching videos, browsing, etc.).<br><br>

Built with Electron, Fish API for voice synthesis, and Gemini API for vision analysis.

## Build Instructions
`cd display_character`<br>
`npm install`<br>

## To start the electron app:
`npm start`
